My name is Arvinth and I am 17 years old.

## My Whakapapa
_I live in a house with both parents, one grandma and my two brothers. I have one twin brother and one brother who is 5 years older. All three of us were born in Singapore and we moved here in 2007 when my twin and I turned 1 year old. Both my parents were born in Sri Lanka and spent a majority of their life their then moved to Singapore in the late 90's/early 2000's and finally came to New Zealand in 2007. I mainly speak English at home but my parents speak tamil around the house and we reply in English as I am able to understand._

**My Interests:**

_One of my main interests outside of school is watching sports. I mainly enjoy watching football, cricket and basketball and occasionally I watch tennis or baseball. I also enjoy gaming and socialising with my friends outside of school._

**My Future Goals:**

_My main goal this year is to get excellence endorsed while also getting a sufficient rank score to qualify for commerce(165) or engineering(260) at UOA. My pathway options are between commerce and engineering and I will decide the main one midway through this year depending on what I prefer._
