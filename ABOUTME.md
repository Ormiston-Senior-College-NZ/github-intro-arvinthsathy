My name is Arvinth and I am 17 years old.

## My Whakapapa
I live in a house with both parents, one grandma and my two brothers. I have one twin brother and one brother who is 5 years older. All three of us were born in Singapore and we moved here in 2007 when my twin and I turned 1 year old. Both my parents were born in Sri Lanka and spent a majority of their life their then moved to Singapore in the late 90's/early 2000's and finally came to New Zealand in 2007.
